Io fibonacci
============

This program is written is plain Io.

The fibonacci sequence basiacally starts with 1 and always returns the sum of the last two numbers as the next number in the sequence. 
Fibonacci sequence = 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, ...

Our program takes a number an returns you it's correspondent character in the fibonacci sequence.
The fourth character of the fibonacci sequence is 3, so if you call fib_method(3) it is going to return 3. 

It is test driven with out self build Io test environment.
